# House Price Prediction

This project predicts **house prices** using machine learning algorithms based on a variety of features such as location, area, rooms, and more.  
It was developed using **Google Colab**, and the model was trained and evaluated using real-world housing data.

## Project Highlights

- Built using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **scikit-learn**
- Preprocessed dataset for missing values, outliers, and encoding
- Trained using **Linear Regression** model
- Achieved high accuracy on test data
- Visualized predictions vs actuals
